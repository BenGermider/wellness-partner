# Macro Planning


### Core Features & Functionality
Session Tracking: Monitor the time users spend actively on their computer. Track session duration and total time.
Customizable Alerts: Send reminders (e.g., take a break, drink water, adjust posture) based on set intervals or excessive session times.
Health Tips & Suggestions: Provide suggestions for simple exercises, stretches, and wellness practices.
User Settings: Allow users to customize the intervals, alert types, and the kinds of suggestions they receive.
Dashboard Widget: A small, unobtrusive widget or toolbar gadget that displays session time, upcoming reminders, and quick settings access.


### Architecture & Technical Components
Platform Compatibility:
Decide if it will be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) or specific to one OS.
Consider using frameworks like Electron (for web-based desktop apps) or native toolkits like .NET (Windows), Swift (macOS), or GTK (Linux).
User Interface Design:
Simple, clean, and non-intrusive UI.
Make it easy for users to interact with the widget and configure settings.
Background Service:
A service or process running in the background to track session time and trigger alerts even when the app is minimized.
Notification System:
Use native OS notifications to alert users without disrupting their work.
Allow snoozing or dismissing reminders easily.


### Tech Stack Options
Frontend/UI:
Web-based: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte if using Electron)
Native: WPF or WinUI (for Windows), SwiftUI (for macOS), GTK or Qt (for Linux)
Backend/Logic:
Cross-Platform: Node.js (with Electron), Python (using PyQt or Tkinter), C# with .NET MAUI
Native OS Support: For more efficient native notifications and background services


### System Design Considerations
Modular Design: Break down the app into components (session tracker, reminder system, UI widget, etc.) to make it easy to maintain and scale.
Data Storage:
Lightweight local storage (SQLite, JSON, or local files) for user preferences, usage logs, etc.
Consider cloud storage if you plan to sync settings across multiple devices.
Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts: Implement a system that tracks user activity and sends alerts based on real-time data, even when the user is in other applications.


### User Experience (UX)
Non-Intrusive Alerts: Make sure notifications don’t disrupt the user’s workflow but are still noticeable enough to encourage a healthy break.
Ease of Use: Simple setup process and intuitive configuration options.
Customizable: Let users configure intervals, notification types, and the types of reminders they receive.


### Potential Integrations
Calendar Integration: Sync with the user’s calendar to avoid alerts during meetings or scheduled events.
Health Apps: Optionally, integrate with existing health apps (like Apple Health, Google Fit) to track user activity and personalize recommendations.
Wearable Devices: Consider future integration with wearables (like smartwatches) for more precise activity tracking and reminders.


### Testing & Security
User Privacy: Ensure that any data collected (like usage patterns) is handled securely and transparently. Consider an option for local-only storage if no cloud is involved.
Cross-Platform Testing: Make sure the app behaves consistently across different OS platforms.
Performance: Ensure that the app runs efficiently without consuming too much CPU/RAM, especially since it runs in the background.


### Scalability & Future Features
Modular Plugin System: You could design it to allow additional plugins in the future (e.g., new types of reminders, integration with more apps).
Gamification: Consider adding small incentives (like badges or achievements) for users who follow healthy practices regularly.
